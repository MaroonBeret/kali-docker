# Kali Linux Docker Container - For the Lazy and Ambitious

## What's This?
A Docker container for Kali Linux, your go-to for feeling like a hacker from a movie.

## Prerequisites
- Docker or podman, for the ones respecting commercial licensing rules and such.

## How to Make Magic Happen
1. **Run the Thing**: Just `./run.sh`. It will tell you what to do.

## Why Though?
- Got tired of spinning up a local VM and paying for the software.
- Why not?

## Disclaimer
Use for good, not evil. Or at least don't get caught.
